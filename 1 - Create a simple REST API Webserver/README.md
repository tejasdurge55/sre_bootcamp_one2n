### For this task we will follow mainly important resources:

[Readme Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

[Best Practices for REST API design](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/)

### Also we will have the Twelve-Factor App guidelines in mind:

[The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/)

### The major points of Best Practices for REST API design include:
- Accept and respond with JSON
- Use nouns instead of verbs in endpoint paths
- Name collections with plural nouns
- Nesting resources for hierarchical objects
- Handle errors gracefully and return standard error codes
- Allow filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Maintain Good Security Practices
- Cache data to improve performance
- Versioning our APIs
